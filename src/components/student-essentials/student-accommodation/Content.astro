          Finding the right place to stay overseas after you’ve enrolled at a
          university can entail several options, while also making it difficult
          to decide. In general, there are three types of study abroad
          accommodation choices, namely: university residence, homestay and
          apartment living.

          If you choose to stay at the university residence, then get ready for
          a myriad of new experiences. You’ll meet foreign students from
          different parts of the world, interact with almost everyone and
          develop long-lasting friendships. With student accommodation at
          universities, facilities like the internet, heating, or electricity
          will be provided for, unlike private apartments.

          However, managing your laundry and doing your own cooking would be a
          sole responsibility, depending on the university you choose. On the
          other hand, when you live in a private apartment, you’d have to manage
          the bill payments, such as the electricity, heating, internet, etc.
          However, you’d have the place all to yourself, so you can plan your
          day’s schedule accordingly.
